# R_Project_NBA. FAN TWEETS
This project is about Text Analytics with Natural Processing Language on R. Specifically I was tasked to analyze millions of tweets regarding the NBA, grouped by month. I chose to analyze the tweets of february since that month happened the "All-Star Game" and wanted to analyze how the audience reacted to it. Furthermore, I analyzed the so called "beef" between two players, Antetoukompo representing Nike and James Harden representing Adidas, and assessed how the two brands were affected by this.
The code is divided into four main parts
1. Importing Libraries
2. Data cleaning - focusing on specific words that filter out unnecessary topics ("stopwords")
3. Organizing the data through matrixes to create plots later on
4. Creating Plots (word cloud, most frequent words, sentiment analysis)
